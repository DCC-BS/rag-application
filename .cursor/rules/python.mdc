NEVER:
- Use circular imports
- Mix responsibilities
- Skip type annotations
- Ignore documentation

3. Dependency Management
ALWAYS:
- Use virtual environments
- Pin dependencies
- Use requirements files
- Handle dev dependencies
- Update regularly

NEVER:
- Mix environment dependencies
- Use global packages
- Skip version pinning
- Ignore security updates

4. Testing Strategy
ALWAYS:
- Write unit tests
- Implement integration tests
- Use proper fixtures
- Test edge cases
- Measure coverage

NEVER:
- Skip test documentation
- Mix test types
- Ignore test isolation
- Skip error scenarios

Code Quality:
- Use proper linting

Documentation:
- Write clear docstrings
- Maintain README
- Document APIs
- Include examples
- Keep docs updated

Development Tools:
- Use proper IDE
- Configure debugger
- Use version control
- Implement CI/CD
- Use code analysis

Best Practices:
- Follow PEP standards
- Keep code clean
- Handle errors properly
- Use proper logging
- Implement monitoring

Package Distribution:
- Use proper packaging
- Handle versioning
- Write setup files
- Include metadata
- Document installation

Remember:
- Focus on maintainability
- Keep code organized
- Handle errors properly
- Document thoroughly

Key Principles

- Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.
- Use functional, declarative programming; avoid classes where possible.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_active, has_permission).
- Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., routers/user_routes.py).
- Favor named exports for routes and utility functions.
- Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.  

Python/FastAPI

- Use def for pure functions and async def for asynchronous operations.
- Use type hints for all function signatures. Prefer Pydantic models over raw dictionaries for input validation.
- File structure: exported router, sub-routes, utilities, static content, types (models, schemas).
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.
- For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
- Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., if condition: do_something()).  

Error Handling and Validation

- Prioritize error handling and edge cases:  
  - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.  
  - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.  
  - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.  
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use the if-return pattern instead.  
  - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.  
  - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.  
  - Use custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.  

Dependencies

- FastAPI
- Pydantic v2
- Async database libraries like asyncpg or aiomysql
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 (if using ORM features)  

FastAPI-Specific Guidelines

- Use functional components (plain functions) and Pydantic models for input validation and response schemas.
- Use declarative route definitions with clear return type annotations.
- Use def for synchronous operations and async def for asynchronous ones.
- Minimize @app.on_event("startup") and @app.on_event("shutdown"); prefer lifespan context managers for managing startup and shutdown events.
- Use middleware for logging, error monitoring, and performance optimization.
- Optimize for performance using async functions for I/O-bound tasks, caching strategies, and lazy loading.
- Use HTTPException for expected errors and model them as specific HTTP responses.
- Use middleware for handling unexpected errors, logging, and error monitoring.
- Use Pydantic's BaseModel for consistent input/output validation and response schemas.   

Performance Optimization

- Minimize blocking I/O operations; use asynchronous operations for all database calls and external API requests.
- Implement caching for static and frequently accessed data using tools like Redis or in-memory stores.
- Optimize data serialization and deserialization with Pydantic.
- Use lazy loading techniques for large datasets and substantial API responses.   

Key Conventions

1. Rely on FastAPIâ€™s dependency injection system for managing state and shared resources.
2. Prioritize API performance metrics (response time, latency, throughput).
3. Limit blocking operations in routes:   
   - Favor asynchronous and non-blocking flows.   
   - Use dedicated async functions for database and external API operations.   
   - Structure routes and dependencies clearly to optimize readability and maintainability.   

Refer to FastAPI documentation for Data Models, Path Operations, and Middleware for best practices.
